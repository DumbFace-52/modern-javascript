## What is an object?
// An object is a collection of key-value pairs. Groups multiple values together.
// Objects are used to store data in a structured way.
// Objects can be used to represent real-world entities, such as people, places, things, or objects.
// Objects can be used to represent complex data structures, such as arrays, objects, or functions.
// Objects can be used to represent functions, such as functions that are used to calculate something.
